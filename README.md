# Chat-Server-Project
Chat Server Project in Java

The Chat Server project is a network-based application built using Java, designed to enable real-time communication between multiple clients through a server. It consists of two main components: the server and the client.

Server Side: The server application is responsible for managing client connections and message distribution. It listens on a specified port for incoming client connections, handles multiple clients simultaneously using multithreading, and maintains a list of connected clients. The server broadcasts messages received from any client to all other connected clients, ensuring a seamless group chat experience.

Client Side: The client application provides a user interface for users to connect to the server, send messages, and receive messages from other clients. Each client connects to the server using its IP address and port number. The client side handles user input and displays chat messages in real-time, ensuring that users remain engaged in the conversation.

Features:

Real-time communication between multiple clients.
Server-side handling of multiple clients using multithreading.
Broadcast messaging system to distribute messages to all connected clients.
Simple and intuitive user interface for easy use.
Robust error handling and connection management.
This project showcases my ability to work with Java networking, multithreading, and user interface design, demonstrating practical knowledge of client-server architecture.
